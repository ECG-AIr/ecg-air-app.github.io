								ECG-Air is the future of ECG based cardiovascular disease prediction and detection via artificial intelligence.
							</p>
							<p>
								We aim to enhance the usefulness of single-lead ECGs increasingly made available by smartwatches and other remote monitoring technologies so that large patient populations will be able to benefit from the early detection of cardiovascular diseas at a low cost. 
								
							</p>
							<p>
								Our team of data scientists, clinicians, and software engineers have developed a platform - ECG-AIr - that can be integrated with ECG-capable smartwatches and electronic health record systems.
